# mgcpgen

This is an LL(1) Parser Generator designed to be used with mgclex.
This was _not_ developed to be the fastest, or even with efficiency in mind.
It was designed to implement the algorithms _correctly_ and understandably
There is a _serious_ lack of Grammar -> AST examples for 
Parser generators - especially LL(1), recursive descent aside.

Hopefully this alleviates that somewhat.
